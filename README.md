ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nikita.  
âœ¨ Iâ€™m in interested in getting a job as a back-end software dev.  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on a telegram bot and have some plans for other projects.  
ðŸ’™ Iâ€™m really looking forward to collaborate on any web projects. Something from a different field would also be very interesting!  
ðŸ“« You can reach me on telegram (@synalice), Discord (synalice#4642) or send an e-mail (nikita.nikita.krasnov@gmail.com).
